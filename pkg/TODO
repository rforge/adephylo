# FOR NEXT STABLE VERSION
=========================
=========================

# CODE ISSUES:
==============
* 

# DOCUMENTATION ISSUES:
=======================
* make a vignette


# NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS:
=====================
* plot methods from phylobase ('old' version) -- done (TJ)
* implement a pathTwoTips method, which has to go fast to find shortest path between two tips - done (TJ): is now sp.tips.
* basic stuff existing in phylog objects (while option=TRUE), e.g. distance to the root for tips, etc.
* proximities between OTUs like Abouheif, etc.
* distances between OTUs (like sum of branch lengths) -- done (TJ)
* dummy vectors indicating class of related OTUs (like in orthogram) -- done (TJ)
* orthogram
* ppca
* put some datasets from ade4



# TESTING:
==========
* test distTips a little more



# LOW PRIORITY / MINOR ISSUES
===========================
===========================
* draw a rectangle around legend in s.phylo4d


# LONG TERM
==========================
==========================
* re-implement all phylogenetic methods from ade4 in adephylo
* implement several phylogenetic proximities
* implement an orthobasis for phylogenies
* write a comprehensive tutorial, going through adephylo, ade4, ape, phylobase, etc.
