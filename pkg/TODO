# FOR NEXT STABLE VERSION
=========================
=========================

# CODE ISSUES:
==============
* fix bug 1.2-2.01 (read.structure issue) -- fixed: was due to the default of "onerowperind" argument.
* fix bug 1.2-2.02 (read.genetix issue) -- fixed: was due to an error in the data file (wrong nloc); now read.genetix corrects that automatically and issues a warning. (TJ)
* fix bug 1.2-2.03 (monmonier issue) -- fixed: was a non-detected code 2 due to intersection check with previously drawn segment (was not always removed). (TJ)
* fix request 1.2-2.04 (implement adjusted heretozygosity in summary)

# DOCUMENTATION ISSUES:
=======================
* make a tutorial for the sPCA -- done (TJ)


# NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS:
=====================
* color plot for the sPCA results, based on RGB representation of Cavalli-Sforza -- done(TJ)
* loadingplot for plotting loadings of one axis -- done (TJ)
* adegenetTutorial function which opens the online tutorials -- done (TJ)
* allow for the use of na.replace and scaleGen in spca function -- done (TJ)
* add rupica dataset -- done (TJ)


# TESTING:
==========
* 



# LOW PRIORITY / MINOR ISSUES
===========================
===========================
* in spca, when nfposi=0, the returned object actually contains what corresponds to nfposi=1. Comes from multispati in ade4. To correct in ade4.
* use spcaIllus to illustrate global.rtest and local.rtest
* check all examples and look for possible improvements
* Implement a method to merge different markers for the same individuals
* Build accessors for marker names, indiv names, pop names, spatial coords, ... -- done in part (nLoc) (TJ)
* Return a spatial object from monmonier (class sp?)
* implement classical Fst sensu Weir 1996
* Implement different levels of ploidy in:
- hybridize
- read.structure
- propShared
* Permit specification of a matrix of spatial weights in spca (email A. Piotti).
*


# LONG TERM
==========================
==========================
* import from geneticsBase -- wait for geneSet to be stable
* export to geneticsBase -- same thing
* see where code needs tuning, and use C/C++
* implement global.rtest and local.rtest for genind/genpop objects
* Implement dudi wrappers for genind / genpop objects -- one step (automatic coercion as data.frames) (TJ)
* Check the formulae provided for Reynolds (consistent with Felsenstein's
formulae, not straightforward reading the original article)
* Implement wrappers for spatial function (Moran's I, Mantel's correlogram, etc.).
