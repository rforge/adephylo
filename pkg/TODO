# FOR NEXT STABLE VERSION
=========================
=========================

# CODE ISSUES:
==============
o make a working package that passes the check -- done (TJ)

# DOCUMENTATION ISSUES:
=======================
* make a vignette


# NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS:
=====================
o plot methods from phylobase ('old' version) -- done (TJ)
o implement a pathTwoTips method, which has to go fast to find shortest path between two tips - done (TJ): is now sp.tips.
o basic stuff existing in phylog objects (while option=TRUE), e.g. distance to the root for tips, etc.
o proximities between OTUs like Abouheif, etc. -- done (TJ)
o distances between OTUs (like sum of branch lengths) -- done (TJ)
o dummy vectors indicating class of related OTUs (like in orthogram) -- done (TJ)
o add a orthobasis method for objects inheriting phylo4 or phylo. -- done(TJ)
o orthogram and multivariate orthogram; use Stephane's version -- done (SD, TJ)
o ppca -- done (TJ)
o migrate datasets from ade4 to adephylo: -- done (TJ)
- carni19.Rd -- done
- carni70.Rd -- done
- lizards.Rd -- done
- maples.Rd -- done
- mjrochet.Rd -- done
- palm.Rd -- done
- procella.Rd -- done
- tithonia.Rd -- done
- ungulates.Rd -- done
* build an orthobasis from treePart dummy variables
* add a Moran's index and a test (is it needed, as we have morangeary ?)



# TESTING:
==========
o test distTips a little more (see Abouheif with an outgroup, otherwise seems ok) -- done (TJ)
o test ppca: are results identical to those with previous implementation? -- done (TJ)



# LOW PRIORITY / MINOR ISSUES
===========================
===========================
* draw a rectangle around legend in s.phylo4d


# LONG TERM
==========================
==========================
* re-implement all relevant phylogenetic methods from ade4 in adephylo
o implement several phylogenetic proximities -- done (TJ)
o implement an orthobasis for phylogenies -- done (TJ)
* write a comprehensive tutorial, going through adephylo, ade4, ape, phylobase, etc.
* new plotting / summary for ppca objects. Maybe move actual plot to a scatter method, and make a plot similar to other plots.
* make a summary method for ppca.
